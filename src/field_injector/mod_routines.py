'''
These are the routines that modify the Enzo parameter file, hierarchy file, and both
the text-based and HDF5 boundary conditions files.  In general, these should not be
modified unless you are very confident that you're doing the right thing, because Enzo
will behave in unpredictable ways if this is not all internally consistent.

    edit_param_file

    Edits the parameter file to add tracer fluid information. This routine may feel
    like it's doing an awful lot of error-checking, but we're trying to do something
    very invasive so we need to be a bit cautious.

    What this routine actually DOES is go through the parameter file and look for the
    line that starts with "UseTracerFluid" and, if it exists, set it to '1' (i.e., on).
    It also looks for the line that starts with "NumberOfTracerFluidFields" and sets
    that to the user-specified values. If those lines to NOT exist then they are created
    and added to the file.  Then, we add DataLabel lines for each of the new tracer fluids.

    Note that we do the check for UseTracerField and NumberOfTracerFluidFields because 
    older simulation datasets (pre implementation of the tracer fluid methods in Enzo) will
    not have those lines at all.
